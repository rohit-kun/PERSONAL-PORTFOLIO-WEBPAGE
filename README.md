## TASK DESCRIPTION

Task 3 of my internship required me to create a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this task was to design a responsive single-page website that showcases my background, skills, and projects. This type of website is essential for any developer, as it serves as a digital resume and helps recruiters or clients get a quick understanding of one’s capabilities.

The site includes four main sections: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. The Home section contains a welcome message with my name and a short description of what I do. The About section includes a brief bio, educational background, and my areas of expertise. The Projects section highlights a few important works — including the quiz app and the chat app from earlier tasks — with short descriptions. Finally, the Contact section includes an email address and GitHub profile link.

A consistent color palette and typography were used throughout the page to ensure a professional look. I used Flexbox for layout and ensured that all sections are mobile-friendly by using percentage-based widths and media queries. The navigation bar remains fixed at the top and allows users to scroll smoothly to each section. All code was written from scratch without any libraries or frameworks.

This project improved my understanding of HTML semantics, CSS layout strategies, and responsive web design. I also learned how to organize a static site into folders and maintain clean, readable code that could be easily expanded later. Additionally, the process helped me reflect on how to present my own story and work to others — a crucial skill for professional branding.

In short, this task allowed me to build a personal web presence from the ground up. The portfolio website not only fulfills internship requirements but will also serve as a valuable tool for my career. It’s clean, easy to navigate, responsive, and clearly presents my developer journey so far.
